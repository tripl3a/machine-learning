# Time Series Forecasting

## Data Set

* Option A: [Bike Sharing in Washington D.C. Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/marklvl/bike-sharing-dataset)
    * `day.csv`: 731 observations x 16 variables (`dteday` (date) and `cnt` (count of total rental bikes) are most relevant for us)
* Option B: [US Candy Production by Month](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/us-candy-production-by-month): 548 observations x 2 variables

## Algorithms

### Statistical Approach

Methods we consider using:

* Exponential models
* ARIMA

### Deep Learning Approach

Network architectures we consider using:

* Feed Forward Neural Networks (FNN)
* Time Lagged Neural Networks (TLNN)
* Seasonal Artificial Neural Networks (SANN)
* Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
